# Progress Tracker: Moops - Tailwind Color Explorer

## Project Status: Initial Development

The project is in its early stages of development. The foundation has been laid with the basic project structure and a minimal implementation of the color grid component.

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript
- ✅ Tailwind CSS integration
- ✅ shadcn/ui components available
- ✅ Basic application structure

### Color Grid Feature
- ✅ Basic TailwindColorGrid component implementation
- ✅ Display of all Tailwind color palettes and shades
- ✅ Click-to-copy functionality for Tailwind class names
- ✅ Responsive grid layout
- ✅ Hex value display for each color
- ✅ Popover with detailed color information
- ✅ Enhanced visual design and interaction feedback
- ✅ Compact ColorFlyoutMenu component for quick color selection

## In Progress

### Color Grid Enhancements
- 🔄 Implementing color selection for palette building

### Palette Management
- 🔄 Creating PaletteContext for state management
- 🔄 Implementing palette data structure
- 🔄 Adding actions for managing palette colors

## Not Started

### Component Previews
- ❌ Login card component
- ❌ Profile card component
- ❌ Settings card component
- ❌ Dynamic theming of components based on selected palette

### Export Functionality
- ❌ JSON export utility
- ❌ Export UI
- ❌ Copy-to-clipboard for export data

### Additional Features
- ❌ Palette persistence (localStorage)
- ❌ Dark/light mode toggle
- ❌ Accessibility checks for color combinations

## Known Issues

1. **Color Grid Layout**: The current vertical layout may not be optimal for all screen sizes.
2. **Performance**: Large number of color swatches may impact performance on lower-end devices.
3. **Clipboard API**: The current clipboard implementation may not work in all browsers.

## Next Release Goals

For the next release, we aim to complete:

1. Enhanced color grid with hex values and selection mechanism
2. Basic palette management functionality
3. At least one preview component (login card)
4. Simple export functionality

## Long-term Roadmap

### Version 0.2
- Complete all core features
- Basic component previews
- Simple export functionality

### Version 0.3
- Enhanced component previews
- Improved palette management
- Local storage persistence

### Version 1.0
- Complete feature set
- Polished UI
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance optimizations

## Contribution Areas

Areas where additional help would be valuable:

1. **UI/UX Design**: Refining the visual design and interaction patterns
2. **Component Development**: Creating the preview components
3. **Color Theory**: Implementing color relationship visualizations
4. **Accessibility**: Ensuring color combinations meet accessibility standards
